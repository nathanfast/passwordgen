# passwordgen

### How to use
1. Open a command line or terminal and change to the directory where you saved the file.

2. Run the program with the "py passwordgen.py" command.

3. Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.

4. The program generates a random password of the desired length and prints it on the screen.

5. Use the generated password for your purposes and store it safely in a secure location.

That's it! I hope you find this tutorial helpful in using the password generator program.



### The technology behind it
The password generator program uses a combination of standard Python libraries to generate a random password. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

Import the required libraries: first, import the string and random libraries. The string library contains a set of predefined strings that can be used for the password generator. The random library is used to select random characters from a given string.

Defining the generate_password function: The generate_password function is defined to generate the password. It takes a length variable as an argument, which represents the desired length of the password.

Generating a string: A string of ASCII letters, numbers and punctuation characters is defined and stored in the chars variable.

Generation of a random password: A loop is used to select length times a random character from the chars string and concatenate these characters. The function returns the resulting password.

Query desired password length: The desired length of the password is entered by the user and converted to an integer.

Calling the generate_password function: The generate_password function is called and the resulting password is printed to the screen.

That's essentially it! This password generator program uses the functionality of standard Python libraries to generate a secure and random password.
